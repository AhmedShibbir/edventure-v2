The education system of Bangladesh is one of the prime sufferers of the population and resource problem we have in general. Online learning, in this context, comes with a lot of opportunities to be explored. However, as though the term “online learning” sounds really promising in trying to solve the resource problem we have, finding out what works out and what doesn’t in an online learning module is really critical. We, in Edventure, believe online learning to be a facilitator of the existing learning eco-system, not a replacement. Learning is an inter-connected process comprising the student, teacher and guardian where we believe spontaneous participation of every stakeholder is extremely important. Our primary mission is to build an eco-system where all the stakeholders are empowered to spontaneously participate in the learning journey by enabling them with necessary resources and relevant modern technologies. Edventure, in a nutshell, is a group of passionate educators and tech professionals who strive to translate their experiences as both student and teacher into the service we are going to offer in order to make education in general easy, fun and personal”",
